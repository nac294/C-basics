# Variables
Now lets talk about the variables in C. Variables are user-defined names that are associated with a specific memory address. You can store whatevery you want
in that variable as long as it is the correct type. Variables can be used in algebraic computations, 
they can be incremented and decremented, and the value they store can be printed to the screen.  

Common C datatypes include 
```C
int // Integer
float // Floating point number
double // Double precision floating point number
char // Single character
void // No datatype
```

## More complex functions
### A function that prints a floating point number in main, passes it into a function that squares it, and then prints the result.

  ```C
  #include <stdio.h>
  
  int main() {
  
    float
  ```
