## This repo describes the basic procedures in C programming. The content starts from the basics and works up to more complex theoretical concepts.
***
Dennis Ritchie wrote the C programming language while working at Bell Labs in 1974.
The language is currently 50 years old, yet it is the [second most popular programming language](https://statisticsanddata.org/data/the-most-popular-programming-languages-1965-2022-new-update/)
as of 2022.

So how is a 50 year old programming language so popular? Considering [Moore's Law](https://www.electrochem.org/moores-law-the-beginnings/) 
and the [three-year half-life](https://spectrum.ieee.org/an-engineering-career-only-a-young-persons-game)
it does not seem possible. The simple answer to C's popularity is *non-functional requirement satisfaction*. At the time, C provided a degree of usability, portability, efficiency that other languages did not. C flourished and it currently acts at the basis for many of the top programming languages   
(Python, Java, C++).
Programs written in C are fast, customizable, and [portable](https://developerexperience.io/articles/software-portability). However, C is a difficult programming language to learn. This guide aims to structure the reader's learning process, and mitigate C's difficulty.
